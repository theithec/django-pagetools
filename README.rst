without changing your workflow with with django, provided you use grappelli.

Let's say, you wrote a great django app that is meant to run in a website. If you have not, think of the polls app from the django tutorial. The website may need a menu, a context sensitive sidebar, maybe the layout or a sidebar should change for different views (or objects)... Django-pagetools aims to be helpfull with such things and to be very flexible doing so and to make changes that easy even clients can work with it.
