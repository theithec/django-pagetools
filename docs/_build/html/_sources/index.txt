Welcome to django-pagetools's documentation!
============================================

Django-pagetools is a set of Django apps to provide some cms-like features

-   menus
-   widgets
-   pages
-   search
-   subscribe/newsletter
-   sections (nested content)

without changing your workflow with with django, provided you use grappelli.

Let's say, you wrote a great django app that is meant to run in a website. If you have not, think of the polls app from the django tutorial. The website may need a menu, maybe the layout or a sidebar should change for different views (or objects), it probably needs a contactform ... Django-pagetools aims to be helpfull with such things and to be very flexible doing so and to make changes that easy even your clients can work with it.
